## Why This Matters

- The biggest jumps are on **geo+boat type** terms and **statewide generics** — exactly where we targeted with static copy updates and long tail capture.

- - Page 2–3 positions are *prime real estate for quick wins*: **a small dev/content push can tip them into Page 1**, where CTR jumps 5–10x.
 
  - - The new Page 1 placement for *offshore boats miami* shows the upside when we get both the content and internal linking in place.
   
    - - We're proving the SEO strategy works even post-reindex — now it's about accelerating it with implementation speed.
