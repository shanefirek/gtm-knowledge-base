## Strategy at a Glance

BoatsForSale.com is poised to own the highest-intent, lowest-competition organic traffic in Florida's marine market. Our competitors dominate broad terms but fail to index long-tail buyer, FSBO and valuation queries. With targeted crawlable pages and schema-backed content, we can win in the places paid ads can't reach and reduce acquisition costs in the process.

## Competitive Summary (SEMrush May 2025)

| Competitor | Visibility % | Avg Rank | Dominates |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| BoatTrader.com | 45.14% | Top 3 | Broad match, statewide terms |
| Boats.com | 13.69% | Top 5 | General listings |
| YachtWorld.com | 10.44% | Top 5 | Luxury yacht space |
| BoatsForSale.com | 8.01% | 83.3 Avg (FL Core) | Mostly brand + low-ranking terms |

**Note:** Our traffic is indexed but underperforming. Pages like /buy/loc-FL and /sell exist but rank poorly due to lack of optimization and content depth.

## Keyword Visibility by Tag

| Tag | Visibility % | Avg. Position | Est. Traffic |
|-----|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| brand | 63.0% | 2.0 | 0.16 |
| florida core | 3.81% | 83.29 | 57.32 |
| valuation | 0.13% | 95.4 | 0.00 |
| long-tail | 0.10% | 96.6 | 0.01 |

## Key Sample Keywords

| Keyword | Current Rank | Intent Type |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| sell my boat in tampa | 85 | FSBO/Seller |
| AI boat valuation florida | N/A | Valuation |
| boats for sale miami | N/A | Buyer |
