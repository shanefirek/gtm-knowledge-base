## Overview

This page centralizes all go-to-market materials for the Brunswick partnership, including Eclipse Marine and Boateka rollout plans. It is designed to support paid media execution, inventory alignment, and forward-looking product integration. The focus is on the pilot window, including regional targeting, ad structure, and performance tracking infrastructure.

## Strategic Focus

We're prioritizing Brunswick's strongest-performing SKUs in Eclipse's current feed — and right now that's predominantly deck boats like the VR6 and Hurricane SS 192RL. Center consoles will absolutely get SEO amplification down the line (due to market demand), but based on real Eclipse inventory, these models are the most strategic to activate first.
